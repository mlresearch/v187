title: Adversarial Attacks are a Surprisingly Strong Baseline for Poisoning Few-Shot
  Meta-Learners
abstract: 'This paper examines the robustness of deployed few-shot meta-learning systems
  when they are fed an imperceptibly perturbed few-shot dataset. We attack amortized
  meta-learners, which allows us to craft colluding sets of inputs that are tailored
  to fool the system’s learning algorithm when used as training data. Jointly crafted
  adversarial inputs might be expected to synergistically manipulate a classifier,
  allowing for very strong data-poisoning attacks that would be hard to detect. We
  show that in a white box setting, these attacks are very successful and can cause
  the target model’s predictions to become worse than chance. However, in opposition
  to the well-known transferability of adversarial examples in general, the colluding
  sets do not transfer well to different classifiers. We explore two hypotheses to
  explain this: ’overfitting’ by the attack, and mismatch between the model on which
  the attack is generated and that to which the attack is transferred. Regardless
  of the mitigation strategies suggested by these hypotheses, the colluding inputs
  transfer no better than adversarial inputs that are generated independently in the
  usual way.'
