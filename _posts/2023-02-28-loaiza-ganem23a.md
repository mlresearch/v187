title: 'Denoising Deep Generative Models '
abstract: Likelihood-based deep generative models have recently been shown to exhibit
  pathological behaviour under the manifold hypothesis as a consequence of using high-dimensional
  densities to model data with low-dimensional structure. In this paper we propose
  two methodologies aimed at addressing this problem. Both are based on adding Gaussian
  noise to the data to remove the dimensionality mismatch during training, and both
  provide a denoising mechanism whose goal is to sample from the model as though no
  noise had been added to the data. Our first approach is based on Tweedieâ€™s formula,
  and the second on models which take the variance of added noise as a conditional
  input. We show that surprisingly, while well motivated, these approaches only sporadically
  improve performance over not adding noise, and that other methods of addressing
  the dimensionality mismatch are more empirically adequate.
