title: 'Volume-based Performance not Guaranteed by Promising Patch-based Results in
  Medical Imaging '
abstract: Whole-body MRIs are commonly used to screen for early signs of cancer. In
  addition to the small size of tumours at onset, variations in individuals, tumour
  types, and MRI machines increase the difficulty of finding tumours in these scans.
  Using patches, rather than whole-body scans, to train a deep-learning-based segmentation
  model with a custom compound patch loss function, several augmentations, and additional
  synthetically generated training data to identify areas where there is a high probability
  of a tumour provided promising results at the patch-level. However, applying the
  patch-based model to the entire volume did not yield great results despite all of
  the state-of-the-art improvements, with over 50% of the tumour sections in the dataset
  being missed. Our work highlights the discrepancy between the commonly used patch-based
  analysis and the overall performance on the whole image and the importance of focusing
  on the metrics relevant to the ultimate user in our case, the clinician. Much work
  remains to be done to bring state-of-the-art segmentation to the clinical practice
  of cancer screening.
