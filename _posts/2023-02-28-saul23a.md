title: 'Lempel-Ziv Networks '
abstract: Sequence processing has long been a central area of machine learning research.
  Recurrent neural nets have been successful in processing sequences for a number
  of tasks; however, they are known to be both ineffective and computationally expensive
  when applied to very long sequences. Compression-based methods have demonstrated
  more robustness when processing such sequences — in particular, an approach pairing
  the Lempel-Ziv Jaccard Distance (LZJD) with the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm has
  shown promise on long sequence problems (up to steps) involving malware classification.
  Unfortunately, use of LZJD is limited to discrete domains. To extend the benefits
  of LZJD to a continuous domain, we investigate the effectiveness of a deep-learning
  analog of the algorithm, the Lempel-Ziv Network. While we achieve successful proof-of-concept,
  we are unable to meaningfully improve on the performance of a standard LSTM across
  a variety of datasets and sequence processing tasks. In addition to presenting this
  negative result, our work highlights the problem of sub-par baseline tuning in newer
  research areas.
